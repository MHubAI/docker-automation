# This file should contain everything needed to run the MHub totalsegmentator testing routine
# NOTE: here we assume the location, the formats and a bunch of other information about the input and
#       output data are known to the user running the script. This is by design, as the user should
#       know what data the pipeline is getting tested on. Plus, once the sample data are chosen
#       the plan is not to change them around too much.

# This YAML entry defines where the input data is stored and where the ouput data should be stored
# If the output of the pipeline changes in format of name, the user will need to update this snippet
# Also, make sure to have the correct read/write permissions on the folders the data are in.
